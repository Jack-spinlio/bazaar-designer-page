    "description": "Brand: fittingsports\n\nThe founder of Fitting Sports is a former badminton athlete who transitioned into the field of sports science after retirement. Dedicated to applying laboratory research to real-world athletic performance, the company focuses on developing professional products tailored to the needs of different sports, aiming to enhance performance and reduce the risk of injury.\r\n\r\nDuring our research, we discovered that although sports socks may seem insignificant, they actually play a crucial role in athletic performance. They not only provide excellent support and friction for the feet but also help absorb impact effectively. Thatâ€™s why we collaborated with the Innovation Sports Technology Lab at National Pingtung University of Science and Technology to develop our patented Pressure Curve Functional Socks (Patent No. I817559). These socks offer exceptional comfort and protection, whether for everyday wear or during sports activities. (For detailed data, please refer to the product description!)",
